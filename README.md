# Human Resource Management Report - Power BI

## About
The Human Resource Management Report was one of the personal projects I worked on during my summer 
internship at KPIM. For this project, I utilized Excel, Power Query, and Power Pivot to extract, 
clean, and filter data from the database, ensuring the creation of accurate data that provided valuable 
insights for assessing Human Resource Management.

In the report, I used Power BI and wrote advanced DAX formulas to track key metrics such as the current 
number of employees, new hires, promotions, resignations, and the company's turnover rate. Additionally, 
the report enabled the evaluation of HR trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly), as well as by 
geographic location, job position, and department. This provided comprehensive HR insights to company 
leaders and the HR department, helping them assess the effectiveness of HR management, make strategic 
decisions, and improve human resource management more effectively.

### 1. Overview of Human Resource Report: 
This report page provides a comprehensive overview of the company's human resource status. Key metrics, 
including the total number of active employees, hires, promotions, attrition count, and turnover rate, are 
prominently displayed at the top using card visuals with reference labels features. This allows for easy 
comparison of the company's current HR status with metrics from previous periods, facilitating better monitoring 
of employee fluctuation trends.

The report also visualizes employee trends over time and across various dimensions, such as department and 
store location. This allows HR professionals and management to track and assess workforce performance effectively,
supporting strategic decision-making.
 


### 2. Detailed of Human Resource Report:

This report page provides a detailed view of the company's active employee trends and organizational structure. 
The filters on the left allow users to adjust the report based on specific dates, stores, departments, and job titles, offering 
a customizable view of employee data.

A key highlight is the organizational chart, which visually represents the companyâ€™s hierarchy, from the founder down to various 
departments and roles, including sales, marketing, HR, and interns. This chart helps users easily understand the structure and 
distribution of roles within the company. Additionally, the structural details table at the bottom with the bookmark feature can 
provides individual employee information such as status, position, and type (full-time/part-time) along with insights into 
the employee fluctuations over time.



### 3. Employee Profile Research:
This page is designed for detailed employee profile research. It features a search function that allows users to select an employee 
from a list, displaying their information prominently at the top. For the selected employee, Cao Nhut Minh, key details such as 
Employee ID, email, current position, department, work type, status, and tenure are shown.

The page is divided into two main sections:
- Working Record: This section lists the employee's work history, including start and end dates, title, department, and store location.
- Absent Record: This section outlines the employee's absence history, detailing the type of absence, date, and time for each recorded absence.
